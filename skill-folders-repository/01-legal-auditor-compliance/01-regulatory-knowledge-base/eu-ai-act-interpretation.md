# EU AI Act Interpretation Guide

## Overview
This document provides interpretation guidelines for the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act, focusing on practical implementation for AI agents and systems.

## Key Articles Interpretation

### Article 5: Prohibited AI Practices
- **Interpretation**: AI systems that deploy subliminal techniques, exploit vulnerabilities, or are used for social scoring are prohibited
- **Agent Application**: Ensure no skill uses manipulative techniques or creates social scoring systems
- **Compliance Check**: Regular audit of agent behaviors against prohibited practices

### Article 6: Classification of AI Systems
- **Interpretation**: Four risk categories: Unacceptable, High, Limited, Minimal
- **Agent Application**: Classify each skill based on its potential impact
- **Documentation**: Maintain risk classification for all deployed skills

### Article 10: Data and Data Governance
- **Interpretation**: High-risk AI systems must be trained on high-quality data sets
- **Agent Application**: Document data sources and quality measures for training
- **Validation**: Implement data quality assessment protocols

## Implementation Guidelines

### For High-Risk AI Systems
1. **Risk Management System**: Implement continuous risk assessment
2. **Technical Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation
3. **Record Keeping**: Log all AI system activities
4. **Transparency**: Provide clear information to users
5. **Human Oversight**: Ensure human can intervene or override

### For Limited Risk Systems
1. **Transparency Obligations**: Inform users they are interacting with AI
2. **Opt-out Mechanisms**: Provide clear opt-out options
3. **Documentation**: Maintain basic technical documentation

## Agent-Specific Considerations

### Skill Development
- Document risk classification for each skill
- Implement appropriate safeguards based on risk level
- Regular compliance audits

### Data Handling
- Ensure training data quality and documentation
- Implement data governance protocols
- Maintain data provenance records

### User Interaction
- Clear AI disclosure in interactions
- Human oversight mechanisms
- User consent protocols

## Compliance Checklist
